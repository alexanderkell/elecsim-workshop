Liberalised electricity markets with many heterogenous players are suited to be modelled with ABMs. ABMs incorporate imperfect information as well as heterogeneous actors. ElecSim models imperfect information through forecasting of electricity demand and future fuel and electricity prices. This leads to agents taking risk on their investments, and model market conditions more realistically.

We demonstrated that increasing carbon tax can lead to an increase in investment of low-carbon technologies. We showed that early decisions have a long-term impact on the energy mix. 

Our future work includes comparing agent-learning techniques, using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to allow agents to learn in a non-static environment. We propose the integration of a higher temporal and spatial resolution to model changes in daily demand, as well as capacity factors by region, and transmission effects. This will allow us to model that demand is met at all times and not just on average.
