The fact that we have a liberalised electricity market with many heterogenous players means that ABMs are suited for modelling these electricity markets.

ABMs are able to model imperfect information as well as heterogeneous actors. ElecSIM models imperfect information through forecasting of electricity demand and future fuel and electricity prices. This leads to agents taking risk on their investments, and more realistically model market conditions.

We demonstrated that increasing carbon tax can lead to an increase in investment of low-carbon technologies. We showed that early decisions have a long-term impact on the energy mix. 

Our future work includes comparing agent-learning techniques, using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to allow agents to learn in a non-static environment. We propose the integration of a higher temporal and spatial resolution to model changes in daily demand, as well as capacity factors by region, and transmission effects.
